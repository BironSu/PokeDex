# PokéDex
Need to learn a bit about a Pokémon anytime you want? This Pokédex can help!
## Overview
One of the first projects I have made using a Pokémon API. The Pokédex displays the Pokémon's name, picture, Pokédex number, type, two abilities + hidden ability (if available) and a description of the Pokémon.
## Features
 * Users can browse through the Pokédex and tap on which ever Pokémon they want to learn about.
   * When tapped, the Pokéball will turn into their 8-bit picture.
 * Users can use the search bar so they can find the exact Pokémon they want to specifically learn more about.
   * The detail page has a more detailed image of the Pokémon as well as more information.
## Navigating through the Pokédex
